# Song Recommendation System

Uses TF-IDF vectorizer and NLTK to tokenize songs and applies cosine similarity to find content-based similar searches.
Deployed using Streamlit.

Missing the cosine.pkl file since it was too large (763MB)

> Better approach would include content-based recommendation + audio feature recommendations (can be extracted from Spotify API).
